#           \\ SCRIPT INITIALLY CREATED BY JOSE PEREIRA, 2019 \\

#                        Loop Close-Design Script:
# ______________________________________________________________________________
#  Performs loop closure (using KIC protocol) with automatic design of the loop
# aminoacids using the LoopModeler mover. The loop to add can be obtained from
# an existing loop (from another pose), or generated from a string. Furthermore,
# existing loops can be extended with additional residues at the C/N terminal.
#  This script assumes the ABC model, so the loop will be added between the end
# of chain A and the beginning of chain B. Read the dosctrings and documentation
# of the single_dock_decoy.py script for more information on how to set up this
# model.
#
#  How to append a new loop from a sequence:
#
#  This strategy can be employed to create a de-novo loop from scratch OR to
# append extra residues at the end of a pre-existing reference loop in order to
# accomodate the necessity for a bigger loop.
#
#  Build a dummy pose from the requested sequence. The pose should have one
# extra residue in the beginning as the pose. This anchor aminoacid nature is
# irrelevant, as only the backbone phi, psi and omega angles are necessary for
# correct positioning. Moreover, if the loop is intended to be closed to another
# part of the protein (i.e: is not a terminal loop), and in order to prevent
# pyrosetta from automatically adding the terminal caps, thus
# allowing for a correct loop closing, use the uncap_selection function in
# ze_utils.pyrosetta_tools module.
#
# Example:
# loop_pose = pose_from_sequence("A" * 7)
# ids = list(range(2, len(loop_pose.sequence()) + 1))
# loop = Fragment(loop_pose, ids)
# loop.append_to(pose, anchor)
